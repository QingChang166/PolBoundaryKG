# Data Source

1. All administrative spatial files are sourced from GADM, which can be accessed [here](https://gadm.org/). Alternatively, you can download these files using the R package “geodata.”

We have corrected some missing names and inaccurate spatial vectors. All spatial vectors for administrative boundaries used to construct the CountryFiles can be accessed [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/rxruup0zl37mvqajsdz1f/ABlv70ASzZRBf-HwBNTGxkw?rlkey=onsoeozu15jojyr6mv0elhkqs&dl=0).

2. Settlement data comes from [Global Urban Polygons and Points Dataset (GUPPD)](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/data/catalog/sedac-ciesin-sedac-uspat-guppd-v1-1.00). 

3. Grid-cell data comes from [PRIO-GRID](https://grid.prio.org/#/).
